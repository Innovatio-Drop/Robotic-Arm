# Robotic-Arm
Mechanical Robotic Arm for industrial purposes
The aim of the project is to enhance the interactivity for controlling the rootic arm in open source bby adding a virtual input and enabling the user to interact with the real world. The robotic arm has six degrees of freedom to do th etasks like pick and place, painting, assembling, self picking tool accesss, etc., with 2 jaaws mechanical gripper and 3 jaws mechanincal gripper which will help the robotic arm to do its mechanical operations. The entire setup of the robotic arm is kept in the real world and simultaneously virtual control setup will be running in the virtual world. The users interacts with the real world and at the same time with the virtual world whcih is running in PC. The movement of the arm in the real world is in picking different tools for mechanical operation.
